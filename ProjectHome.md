This is a place for me to park a lot of random little bits of open source code I've written over the years, which may or may not be actively maintained, but people might want to grab.

Things that are here:
- very old hiptop source code for an infocom runtime, calculator, japanese dictionary, and experimental japanese input method
- openblt, a hobbiest OS that I hacked on from 1997-2000 or so
